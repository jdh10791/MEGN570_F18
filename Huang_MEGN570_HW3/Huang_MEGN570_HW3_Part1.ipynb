    "I am working to model a symmetric cell with BaCo$_{0.4}$Fe$_{0.4}$Zr$_{0.1}$Y$_{0.1}$O$_{3-\\delta}$ (BCFZY) electrodes and BaCe$_{0.7}$Zr$_{0.1}$Y$_{0.1}$Yb$_{0.1}$O$_{3-\\delta}$ (BCZYYb) electrolyte. At the moment, my model only considers a half-cell with a single electrode layer. The electrolyte is fully dense, while the electrod is microporous with particle size on the order of 100 nm. The figure below illustrates a full cell configuration; my current model considers only the top half of the figure. (Figure from Duan *et al., Nature 349*(6254), 2015.)\n",

Since the cathode is a triple conductor, triple phase boundaries are no longer relevant, and the cathode-eletrolyte interface becomes the relevant boundary for charge transfer. My initial assumption is that the dominant charge transfer mechanism is the transfer of protons via the oxygen lattice:\n",

    "It's also possible that oxygen vacancies and holes may exchange at the interface, but I would expect these reactions to be slower due to (1) the larger size of oxygen and (2) the low hole conductivity in the electrolyte. For now, these reactions are ignored.\n",

    "Oxide ions, protonated oxygens, and oxygen vacancies, which all occupy the oxygen lattice, are the mobile charge carriers currently considered in the model. The relationships between the mole fractions of these species are governed by charge balance, site balance, and the oxidation states of multivalent cations. For the electrolyte, if we assume $k$ formula units of Ce$^{3+}$, $0.7-k$ formula units of Ce$^{4+}$, $x$ formula units of O, $y$ formula units of oxygen vacancies, and $z$ formula units of OH, then charge and site balance give two equations:\n",

In reality some fraction of the cations may be in the $3+$ oxidation state, but I am only concerned with net charge for now, so this gives the same effective range of net charge. $x$, $y$, and $z$ are defined in the same way as they were for the electrolyte. Again assuming $k$ and $l$ fixed and choosing the amount of OH as the independent variable, charge and site balance give:\n",

    "In the future, I plan to consider charge transfer between the oxygen lattice and the transition metal lattice in the cathode phase. This will allow for charge transport via holes on transition metal sites, which may compete with charge transport via the oxygen lattice depending on the carrier mobilities and concentrations in each phase. Allowing the oxidation states of the metal cations to vary will relax the constraints on $k$ and $z$ in the charge balance equations above, resulting in multiple independent variables. I will need to track two of the three oxygen lattice species, and enough transition metal mole fractions to fully determine the transition metal state."
